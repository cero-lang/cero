# Security

## Report a security issue
Cero welcomes security reports and is committed to providing prompt attention to security issues. Security issues should be reported privately to [wroy@proton.me](mailto:wroy@protonmail.com). Security issues should not be reported via the public GitHub Issue tracker.

## Vulnerability coordination
Remediation of security vulnerabilities is prioritized by the project team. The project team coordinates remediation with third-party project stakeholders via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories). Third-party stakeholders may include the reporter of the issue, affected direct or indirect users of Cero, and maintainers of upstream dependencies if applicable.

Downstream project maintainers and Cero users can request participation in coordination of applicable security issues by sending your contact email address, GitHub username(s) and any other salient information privately to [wroy@proton.me](mailto:wroy@protonmail.com). Participation in security issue coordination processes is at the discretion of the project team.

## Security advisories
Cero is committed to transparency in the security issue disclosure process. Security issues shall be announced via [Cero Release notes](https://github.com/cero-lang/cero/releases).
